# Chess-Like Game

## Project Overview

This project is a chess-like game designed with a server-client architecture. It leverages WebSocket for real-time communication, allowing players to interact seamlessly. The game is played on a 5x5 grid where two players control characters with unique movement abilities, adding strategic depth to the gameplay.
